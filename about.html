      <h2>Racing</h2>

          <p>I grew up around racing so I love being at any track and if I can't go to the track on the weekend I will watch racing on tv. The racing I enjoy watching are Indycar, Nascar, Cars Tour, Endurance racing, Dirt Late Model, Winged Sprint Cars, Dirt Midget, Drag Racing, and Motorcycle racing but I do follow every racing series since I can't watch all them.</p>
          <p>I'am pretty good at telling you is going to win the race since I watch every week. I'am good at knowing the rules for each series and when there is a new rule I look into it so I can understand it. I'am pretty good at figuring out where a someone is going if they don't renew their contract with the team.</p>
            <p class="line">I enjoy looking at the history of racing from the drivers to tracks that are still here and some that are not. I will listen to racing podcast on spotify since they talk about the race on the weekend and the upcoming race.</p>

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/PSX-Console-wController.jpg">
            <p>I have been playing video games since Playstation 1 and have not stopped since it got me into technology. The games I enjoy playing are iRacing, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Arma 3, The Witcher 3, and Battlefield but I will sometimes play other style of games.</p>
            <p class="line">I'am decent at iRacing if I don't get into other peoples trouble which is sometimes hard since there are people that loves just to wreck people and don't care about the racing part. I'am used to be good at the recon class in Battlefield.</p>

          <h2>Sports</h2>

              <p>I enjoyed playing sports before I quit since I overheat pretty easily in the heat but I still enjoy watching sports. I like to watch Hockey even tho I never played it and Baseball since I understand it from the years I played.</p>
              <p>When hockey season starts I will not cut my hair until the season ends. I got into hockey from watching the fighting on youtube and thought that is pretty cool since no other sport allows fighting but now I watch for the game and not as much for the fighting.</p>
                <p>I'am pretty good at figuring out what penalty the players will be getting since I did read the rule book because I was bored. I can guess pretty good on who is going to win the game.</p>
                  <p>I'am ok a guessing who is going to win the game. I'am good at if it's a homerun by the sound of the bat. I enjoy seeing the funny moments of the players since it shows that they enjoy the game.</p>
